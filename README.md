# Drone Mapping Software for Development in Agriculture Industry
I find interest in [this article](https://gbksoft.com/blog/drone-mapping-software-for-agriculture/#toc-drone-mapping-software-application-overview) since I used to be Environmental Science major. It demonstrates how drones along with mapping softwares play an innovative role in agricultural management. Farmers used to rely on satellite graph to get the general picture of a field(costly and unflexible). Now, agricultural drones provide them comprehensive field displays as well as analysis on each individual crop thanks to well-developed image analysis softwares. By catching frequency of light reflected from crop leaves, a drone is able to measure health condition of individual crops and subsequently generate maps indicating areas in need of specific treatment. With increasing technological contribution to the farms, agricultural production keeps promoting efficiency.
