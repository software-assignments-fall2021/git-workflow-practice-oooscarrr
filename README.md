# Drone Mapping Software for Development in Agriculture Industry
I find interest in [this article](https://gbksoft.com/blog/drone-mapping-software-for-agriculture/#toc-drone-mapping-software-application-overview) since I used to be Environmental Science major. It demonstrates how drones along with mapping software play an innovative role in agricultural management. Farmers used to rely on satellite graph to get the general picture of a field(costly and unflexible), but now, agricultural drones provide them comprehensive field displays as well as analysis on each individual crop thanks to some well-developed image analysis software. By catching the frequency of light reflected from crop leaves, a drone is able to measure health condition of individual crop and subsequently generate maps indicating areas in need of specific treatment. With technological contribution to farms increasing around the world, agricultural production keeps promoting efficiency.
